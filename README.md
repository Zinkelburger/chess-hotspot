# Chess Hotspot
<https://chesshotspot.com>

Just wanna have all the chess clubs/parks in one place so I can search them and easily find games in new places.

1. Create file `.env.local` containing `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_STYLE=https://basemaps.cartocdn.com/gl/voyager-gl-style/style.json`

2. `pnpm dev`

Goal: only show very active spots
Continuously verify and remove inactive spots
